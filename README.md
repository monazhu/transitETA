# Transit ETA: Predicting Transit Arrival Times

Author: Mona Zhu

## Project Overview

While Google Maps can provide users with when buses might arrive based on their scheduled times, real time traffic may make the task of predicting whether buses will arrive late or early a difficult task. 

The current project aims to build a predictive model that would provide an estimation of how much buses are expected to deviate from their scheduled time, depending on factors such as time of day.
